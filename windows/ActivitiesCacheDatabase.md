## Activities Cache Database

Windows activity history keeps track of activity on a device, such as apps and
services usage, files opened, and websites browsed. This activity history is
stored locally on the device in a SQLite database file:

```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\L.%USERNAME%\ActivitiesCache.db
```

### Versions

The activity cache databases were first observed on Windows 10 1803.
